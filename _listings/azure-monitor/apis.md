description: Autoscale is a built-in feature of Cloud Services, Mobile Services, Virtual
  Machines, and Websites that helps applications perform their best when demand changes.
  Of course, performance means different things for different applications. Some apps
  are CPU-bound, others memory-bound. For example, you could have a web app that handles
  millions of requests during the day and none at night. Autoscale can scale your
  service by any of these&mdash;or by a custom metric you define.
