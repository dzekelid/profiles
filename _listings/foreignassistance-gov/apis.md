description: The ForeignAssistance.gov website provides a view of U.S. Government
  foreign assistance funds and enables users to examine, research, and track aid investments
  in a standard and easy-to-understand format. The ForeignAssistance.gov website was
  initiated by the Department of State and USAID under the policy guidance of the
  National Security Council. Future iterations of the site will be developed in consultation
  with U.S. Government agencies receiving or implementing foreign assistance.
