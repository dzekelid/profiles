description: Dat is a grant funded, open source project housed in the US Open Data
  Institute. While dat is a general purpose tool, we have a focus on open science
  use cases. The high level goal of the dat project is to build a streaming interface
  between every database and file storage backend in the world. By building tools
  to build and share data pipelines we aim to bring to data a style of collaboration
  similar to what git brings to source code.
