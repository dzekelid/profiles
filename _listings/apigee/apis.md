description: Apigee Edge is a platform for developing and managing API proxies. Think
  of a proxy as an abstraction layer that fronts for your backend service APIs and
  provides value-added features like security, rate limiting, quotas, analytics, and
  more. The primary consumers of Edge API proxies are app developers who want to use
  your backend services.
