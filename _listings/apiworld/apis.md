description: 'If you&rsquo;re a tech company, you are likely publishing or consuming
  API&rsquo;s already.API World is the first large-scale conference and expo with
  the goal of organizing this new API Economy. The API World 2018 Conference and Expo
  was created with the mission to be neutral and facilitate connections, knowledge,
  trust and business within the developer community of API providers and consumers.
  If you are a coder, a startup or an enterprise that consumes or provides multiple
  APIs this is your event.Decentralization: The move to APIs follows a technology-wide
  trend towards decentralization that includes Agile methodologies and the DevOps
  movement. Beyond the decentralization of public web services, we are seeking the
  decoupling of monolithic API infrastructure into microservices. The rise of containers
  and kubernetes for rapid deployment, scalability, orchestration of microservices
  moves us further towards decentralization. The new movements towards API and microservice
  protocols and serverless architecture reinforces this move towards decentralization.
  The theme of API World 2018 is the move towards decentralization of both public-facing
  and internal API architecture.The next conference is September 10&ndash;12, 2018
  | San Jose Convention Center.'
