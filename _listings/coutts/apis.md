description: Coutts /??ku?ts/ is a private bank and wealth manager, founded in 1692.
  It is the seventh oldest bank in the world and its international arm was sold to
  Union Bancaire Priv&eacute;e in March 2015. It has been owned by the Royal Bank
  of Scotland Group (RBS) since 2000, when RBS purchased its parent, NatWest. Coutts
  formed part of RBSs private banking division. During its time with RBS, it acquired
  Z&uuml;rich-based Bank von Ernst &amp; Cie and in 2008, Coutts Bank von Ernst and
  other Coutts International subsidiaries became RBS Coutts Bank. These traded as
  RBS Coutts International to align them with the parent RBS Group until 2011, when
  RBS Coutts was renamed Coutts &amp; Co. Limited.
