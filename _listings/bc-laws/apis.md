  Columbia and published in partnership with the Ministry of Justice and the Law Clerk
  of the Legislative Assembly. BC Laws contains a comprehensive collection of BC legislation
  and related materials. It is available on the internet in two forms: First: The
  library is available as a web site in which users can browse and search the laws
  of British Columbia. Second: The library is available as a portal to legislation

  based on the structure of the data and all the associated search functionality inherent
  in that structure. The BC Laws website itself is an example of one such application.'
