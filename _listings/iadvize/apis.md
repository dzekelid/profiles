description: We&rsquo;re all about great conversations, they&rsquo;re at the heart
  of what we do. We believe in conversations that spark curiosity, questions, reflexion
  and action. iAdvize&rsquo;s first conversation was between founders Julien and Jon
  when they first chatted about how a chat solution could add a human touch to online
  customer service. Well that conversation never ended and now, there are 180 of us.
  We&rsquo;re still conversing and the chat tool&rsquo;s become a conversational marketing
  platform. Join the conversation is iAdvize&rsquo;s rallying cry. It&rsquo;s an invitation
  to hack the established, to design the unexpected, to ship the unsinkable, to delight
  the customer and to join the party.
