The OpenOnderwijs API alleviates this problem by providing a unified interface to data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as DUO, Onderwijsinspectie and Vensters voor Verantwoording. The OpenOnderwijs API is built on open source technology, such as Scrapy for scraping school data (the scrapers can be found at Github), Sphinx for the documentation, and ElasticSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval. Also, all school addresses are geocoded using the BAG42 service, an Dutch initiative aiming to integrate high quality, official data sources with &ldquo;regular&rdquo; geocoding.",

If you are a coder, a startup or an enterprise that consumes or provides multiple APIs this is your event.Decentralization: The move to APIs follows a technology-wide trend towards decentralization that includes Agile methodologies and the DevOps movement. Beyond the decentralization of public web services, we are seeking the decoupling of monolithic API infrastructure into microservices. The rise of containers and kubernetes for rapid deployment, scalability, orchestration of microservices moves us further towards decentralization. The new movements towards API and microservice protocols and serverless architecture reinforces this move towards decentralization. The theme of API World 2018 is the move towards decentralization of both public-facing and internal API architecture.The next conference is September 10&ndash;12, 2018 | San Jose Convention Center.",

Simply create a job in the AWS Management Console and a Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to you*. Once it arrives, attach the appliance to your local network, download and run the Snowball client to establish a connection, and then use the client to select the file directories that you want to transfer to the appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer the files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the appliance is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update and you can track the job status viaAmazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), text messages, or directly in the Console.Snowball uses multiple layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.",

But unlike any other relational database service, Cloud Spanner scales horizontally, to hundreds or thousands of servers, so it can handle the highest of transactional workloads. With automatic scaling, synchronous data replication, and node redundancy, Cloud Spanner delivers up to 99.999% (five 9s) of availability for your mission critical applications. In fact, Google&rsquo;s internal Spanner service has been handling millions of queries per second from many Google services for years.",
