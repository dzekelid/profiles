description: Lelylan is a project called to life by the need to solve technological
  limitations that home automation (aka domotics) faces today. Our houses are furnished
  by numerous devices like appliances, lighting systems, alarms, irrigation systems,
  smoke and gas detectors, heating, cooling, audio, video systems and much more. Unluckily,
  those devices use different standards and they can not communicate with each other.
  The consequences are higher prices, technical limitations, few services and a lot
  of confusion for the end user.
