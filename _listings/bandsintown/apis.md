description: Concert discovery has changed. Previously, fans would seek out concert
  dates, but with the rise of social media, fans now expect that information to come
  to them. Bandsintown simplifies concert discovery by allowing music fans to Track
  their favorite artists, see which shows they have RSVP&rsquo;d to &amp; share these
  shows with their friends. The concerts are then synced with their calendar, so fans
  are sure not to miss the show.
