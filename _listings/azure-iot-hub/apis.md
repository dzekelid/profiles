description: Jumpstart your Internet of Things project with Microsoft IoT Hub. Connect,
  monitor, and control billions of IoT assets running on a broad set of operating
  systems and protocols. Establish reliable, bi-directional communication with these
  assets, even if they&rsquo;re intermittently connected, and analyze&mdash;and act
  on&mdash;incoming telemetry data. Enhance the security of your IoT solutions by
  using per-device authentication to communicate with devices that have the appropriate
  credentials. Revoke access rights to specific devices to maintain the integrity
  of your system.
