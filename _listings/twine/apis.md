description: 'Twine Health is a cloud-based collaborative care platform for chronic
  disease management. It consists of a patient engagement portal, a peer support network,
  a care management solution, and an outcome analytics tool. The platform enables
  users to co-create personalized care plans that serve as common ground for collaboration
  with their care team: their own providers such as physicians and nurse practitioners;
  their family and friends; and coaches such as nurses, pharmacists, health coaches,
  and more.'
